What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	We can add and delete files from staging area. We can add them when we made changes.
	Thus, we can manage our files and changes before we commit them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	We may change couple of files but they consist different logical changes. We can
	add only related changes to the staging area and commit them first. Then, we can
	commit other changes later.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	When we're working on a new version of our program, such as adding new features and

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	It helps us to track which branch created on which commit. Eases the understand
	what are differences.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
