When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Maybe, when working together with someone, we don't always want to sync
	with their changes or we may work on same thing simultaneously. Their changes
	may brake our work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is copying someone's repo on GitHub to your GitHub. Cloning is making
	a copy of repo on local. Branch is a way to make experimental changes and
	add new features to your repo with keeping the current version as is.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It may avoids conflicts when we are working on the code. If it always syncs
	remote and local our part may change by someone's commit. It's similar to
	making pulls manually.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    We may send changed files each other or directly work on a server with files
	we are working. It may save us from Git commands and would be easier for who 
	doesn't used to Git. But, these would be hard to cooperate and track the changes.	

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When we want to add new features without lost the current version. Thus, we can
	work on to add new things without fear. Also, we can collaborate with others
	on different branches for every feature.
