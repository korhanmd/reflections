What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a repository but not commits. We need to do it to track our versions.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	We can add and delete files from staging area. We can add them when we made changes.
	Thus, we can manage our files and changes before we commit them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	
	We may change couple of files but they consist different logical changes. We can
	add only related changes to the staging area and commit them first. Then, we can
	commit other changes later.
